In current directory:
	Run "make all" to create executable 'finds'
	Run "make clean" to clean files create from make all

Using 'finds' program:

	$	./finds -p pathname [-f c|h|S] [-l] -s regex

	NOTE:
	 --> When using -l, files are only searched for ONCE and the file-name outputted will be either the path of the symbolic link or the file refered to by the symbolic link, which ever is read first
